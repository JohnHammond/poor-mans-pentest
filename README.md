# Poor Man's Pentest


**This project and code is no longer maintained or supported.**

This idea began as a _very crude_ way to "automate" simple tasks on a remote target, by using `xte` and X11 automation utilities to merely send keys and simulate keyboard strokes. This would run commands on the target if a window with a reverse shell or bind shell was displayed on your desktop. It was extremely primitive -- it had no way of determining the output of commands, if commands were truly present, and it was a hodgepodge of haphazard scripts that had no support or error checking.

**The use of the Poor Man's Pentest is _NOT RECOMMENDED_ and this repository is archived.**

It is recommended you use [pwncat](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat) for things like this.

While I have given [a presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2aSXGbD0NE) on the cheeky idea for the Poor Man's Pentest years ago, we have upskilled and since then worked on the pwncat project, which [we have also presented on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CISzI9klRkw).

Please consider this Poor Man's Pentest repository dead.
